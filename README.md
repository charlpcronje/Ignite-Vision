# Ignite Vision

## Overview
- The system, known as "Ignite Vision" aims to provide a seamless and user-friendly mobile application for Android and iOS platforms.
- The primary purpose of the software is to enable users to capture photos of financial transaction slips using their device's camera.
- Once a photo is taken, the system performs edge detection and image optimization to enhance the quality.
- Users can choose the destination for uploading the image via an API call, with options displayed for selection.
